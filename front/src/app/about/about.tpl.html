      <h3 class="color-text fw400"><i>Never miss great offers & product updates from the brands you love</i></h3>

      <p>You follow hundreds of brands on Facebook — maybe thousands — and when you open Facebook, it can feel like you’ve missed some of their most important posts, great deals, sales or product updates. Today, we’re excited to share a new mobile app that helps you catch up on the best stuff from brands you follow.</p>

      <h4>How does it work?</h4>

      <p>You install ShopNow on your smartphone; then after being registered, the updates you’re most likely to care about will appear in the Discover tab, and the active offers will appear in the Offers tab. At any point, just pull-to-refresh to see all new updates and offers.</p>

      <p>All the brands you love are able to deliver personalised offers and discounts for you, and we will notify you when the offers are ready to use.</p>

      <p>We’ll be listening to your feedback and making the app even better over time. We love it and think you will too. If you don’t, send your thoughts our way.</p>

      <p>We think this is a great way to get even more out of Facebook and we’re excited for you to experience it. Let us know what you think!</p>

      <p>The app is available for iOS devices and we are working hard to bring this to the Android platform.</p>

      <p>Download ShopNow now and get your daily mid-morning inspiration for shopping.</p>
